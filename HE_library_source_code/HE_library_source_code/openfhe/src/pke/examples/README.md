OpenFHE Lattice Cryptography Library - Examples
=============================================

Two Basic Examples 


Add BFV
============================================
This Example demonstrate simple Homomorphic Encryption using BFV scheme
Generate Homomorphic Encryption Keys
Encrypt three numbers
Carry out Homomorphic Multiplication and Addition on this three numbers
Measure the run time of Multiplication and Addition operations
Output the results from both operations and time each operation took.


Add BGV
============================================
This Example demonstrate simple Homomorphic Encryption using BGV scheme
Generate Homomorphic Encryption Keys
Encrypt three numbers
Carry out Homomorphic Multiplication and Addition on this three numbers
Use Modulo Reduction to reduce the ciphertext after multiplication
Measure the run time of Multiplication and Addition operations
Output the results from both operations and time each operation took.
